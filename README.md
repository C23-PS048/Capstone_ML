## Dataset 

We have gathered a wide variety of data about the plants available on Kaggle, in total we have collected 15 types of plants and their respective diseases. However, the dataset as a whole is still unbalanced due to the limitations of the data available in the public dataset. To avoid highly biased models, we and our advisor decided to split the dataset into subsets which currently only support 3 crops: Chili, Tomato, Cauliflower.
